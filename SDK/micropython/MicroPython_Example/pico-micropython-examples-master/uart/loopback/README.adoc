= Using UART on the Raspberry Pi Pico
:xrefstyle: short

Send data from the UART1 port to the UART0 port. Other things to try;

[source,python]
----
uart0 = UART(0)
----

which will open a UART connection at the default baudrate of 115200, and

[source,python]
----
uart0.readline()
----

which will read until the CR (\r) and NL (\n) characters, then return the line.
